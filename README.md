# PractiScore

This is my own iteration of the Practiscore app...because that app is trash. 
I hope to use this application as an example to show my skills as a developer and build my portfolio.
This is intended to be used as a proof-of-concept, not a full on replacement. Initially it will only have events and
registrations, but could be expanded into scoring management. How Practiscore proper does this is a mystery...
